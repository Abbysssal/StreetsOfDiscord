**Here's what we need help with right now:**
- **Status effect classes**. `Tick()` method will be called every virtual second. You can find all info on status effects in `StatusEffects` class. Examples: `StatusEffects/Regeneration.cs`, `StatusEffects/Poison.cs`.

You can look at other source files to make sure that you have everything needed in yours.
